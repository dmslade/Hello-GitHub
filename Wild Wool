<h1>An excerpt from "Wild Wool"</h1>

<h2>By John Muir</h2>

   <p>
    No dogma taught by the present civilization seems to form so insuperable an obstacle in the way of a right 
    understanding of the relations which culture sustains tow ildness as that which regards the world as made 
    especially for the uses of man. Every animal, plant, and crystal controverts it in the plainest terms. Yet it is 
    taught from century to century as something ever new and precious, and in the resulting darkness the enormous 
    conceit is allowed to go unchallenged.
    </p> 
    <p>
    I have never yet happened upon a trace of evidence that seemed to show that any one animal was ever made 
    for another as much as it was made for itself. Not that Nature manifests any such thing as selfish isolation. In the making of every animal the presence of every other animal has been recognized. Indeed, every atom in 
    creation may be said to be acquainted with and married to every other, but with universal union there is a division 
    sufficient in degree for the purposes of the most intense individuality; no matter, therefore, what may be 
    the note which any creature forms in the song of existence, it is made first for itself, then more and more 
    remotely for all the world and worlds.
    </p>

    Were it not for the exercise of individualizing cares on the 
    part of Nature, the universe would be felted together like a 
    fleece of tame wool. But we are governed more than we know, and most when we 
    are wildest. Plants, animals, and 
    stars are all kept in place, bridled along appointed ways, 
    with one another, and through the midst of one another -- 
    killing and being killed, eating and being eaten, in harmonious 
    proportions and quantities. And it is right that we should thus 
    reciprocally make use of one another, rob, cook, and consume, to the utmost of our healthy abilities and 
    desires. Stars attract one another as they are able, and harmony results. Wild lambs eat as many wild flowers 
    as they can find or desire, and men and wolves eat the lambs to just the same extent.
