                     Growing up was different for me, because of my medical conditions. I was diffenet with my fellow
                     student's, they where doing thing that they when order not to do while I was focus on the school
                     work. I remember when the Business class at FCAHS, them where doing a field trip them still at an
                     hotel, one of them was taking drugs, the one that took the drugs tall the teacher two other were
                     drinking alcohol, but the two not doing anything because they have been asleep.
